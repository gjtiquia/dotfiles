# dotfiles

documentation of all my dotfiles, config files, etc

## $HOME dotfiles

### Linux

Ubuntu: 

### MacOS


### Windows

WSL (Ubuntu): https://github.com/gjtiquia/.wsl_dotfiles
> technically can have the same as Ubuntu but... just in case lol

Cygwin: https://github.com/gjtiquia/.cygwin_dotfiles


## shared dotfiles



## goals and non-goals

some people like to put all their dotfiles into a single repo

that doesnt work for me, cuz i find that some dotfiles are machine/OS/runtime specific, and some are shared

i prefer a more "modular" approach, where config files are as "self-contained" as possible

this way i can choose individually which dotfiles are "shared", which are not

some people like to use `GNU Stow` for managing their dotfiles

i prefer not to, as i want less dependencies as possible, and a setup that works across Windows, MacOS, and Linux
