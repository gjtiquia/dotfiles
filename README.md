documentation of all my dotfiles, config files, etc

## $HOME dotfiles



## shared dotfiles



## goals and non-goals

some people like to put all their dotfiles into a single repo

that doesnt work for me, cuz i find that some dotfiles are machine/OS/runtime specific, and some are shared

i prefer a more "modular" approach, where config files are as "self-contained" as possible

this way i can choose individually which dotfiles are "shared", which are not
